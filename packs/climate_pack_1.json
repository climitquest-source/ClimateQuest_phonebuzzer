          "answer": "Reuse, Reduce and Recycle",
          "explanation": "The three 'R's encourage us to cut down on what we consume, find new uses for items we already have, and recycle materials to keep them out of landfill."

          "answer": "True",

          "answer": "Green bin",

          "answer": "Disconnect to the city's sewer system; better at 2 metres away from the foundation",
