    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>Cli‑Mit Quest is easy to learn. Follow these steps to get started:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Choose your teams.</strong> Decide whether you’re playing solo or with up to four teams. Enter a name and pick a colour for each team.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable buzzers.</strong> If you have smartphones available, click “Enable Phone Buzzers” on the Play page. Each player joins the game with the provided room code or QR code and selects their team. If you don’t have phones, print the colour buzzers and hand them out.</li>
      <li><strong>Start the game.</strong> After setup, click “Start Game.” The game board will appear with five categories and five point values in each. Click a point value to reveal the question.</li>
      <li><strong>Buzz in.</strong> When a question appears, everyone has 10&nbsp;seconds to read it. After that, the buzzers open and players race to buzz. The first buzz selects that team, who then has 20&nbsp;seconds to answer. The host can also select a team manually using the colour buttons.</li>
      <li><strong>Judge the answer.</strong> After a team answers, click “Show Answer.” If correct, award the points; if not, click “Wrong” to reopen buzzers for another attempt or “Burnout” if no one can answer. The tile disappears only on a correct answer or burnout.</li>
      <li><strong>Finish the board.</strong> Play continues until all questions are answered or burned out. A final scores screen appears with rankings and a Play Again option.</li>
    </ol>
